# Pent Up! on the web

Code repository for the Pent Up! band website.

This repository serves as a collaboration point for developers working on the Pent Up! website.

All branches should be created from the `release` repository and merged back in.  Only when the `release` branch is fully tested can it be merged
with `master`, which will invoke an automatic deployment to Heroku, making the changes live immediately.
