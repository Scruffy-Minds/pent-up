                <div class="artist-bio">
                    <p>Pent Up! is a high-energy rock band formed in 2021 amidst the boredom and isolation of the COVID-19
                    pandemic. As the world ground to a halt, drummer Nate Oelrich, guitarist Brendan Honeycutt, and
                    bassist Jay Barrett started jamming together in a basement. By 2022, the newly christened Pent Up!
                    had started writing songs, releasing music, and blowing the roof off of every Seattle area club that
                    would have them. In 2023, guitarist Nick Kurtz came aboard to round out the lineup, adding his
                    considerable melodic chops to the band’s crackling live energy.</p>

                    <p>Pent Up! combines driving rhythms and catchy songcraft with punk energy and abandon. Their songs
                    blend power pop and punk rock with hints of 90s alt-rock heroes like Dinosaur Jr. and Foo Fighters,
                    with lyrics aimed at the head as well as the heart.</p>

                    <p>In March of 2022, the band released their first single, Self-Titled, off their debut EP, Pretty
                    Good. They flexed their DIY muscles on their next single release, self-producing The End and a cover
                    of The Cure’s Just Like Heaven. On stage the band found plenty of success, opening for national
                    (Tantric) and international (Australia’s Big League) touring acts, as well as successfully
                    headlining an epic show at the High Dive in Fremont.</p>

                    <p>In 2023, Pent Up! seeks to go even bigger, better, and bolder with numerous releases planned, and
                    plenty of live performances to help spread their brand of rambunctious rock to fans new and old.
                    This year is a rocking party, and Pent Up! is ready to bring the house down.</p>
