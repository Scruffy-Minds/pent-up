                <div class="artist-bio">
                    <p>Pent Up! is a high-energy rock band formed in 2021 amidst the boredom and isolation of the COVID-19
                    pandemic. With the world ground to a halt, drummer Nate Oelrich and guitarist Brendan Honeycutt
                    started jamming in a basement. After tapping bassist Jay Barrett to round out the lineup the newly
                    christened Pent Up! wrote songs, recorded demos, and spent the band's first year together blowing
                    the roof off of every Seattle area club that would have them. As 2022 came to a close, guitarist
                    Arcadio Rodriguez came aboard, adding a new melodic dimension to the band's fiery live energy.</p>

                    <p>Pent Up! combines driving rhythms and catchy songcraft with punk energy and abandon, where hints of
                    bands like Dinosaur Jr., Foo Fighters, and Social Distortion mix with indie rock and pop. Their
                    high-energy songs contain lyrics aimed at connecting with audiences on a personal level, written to
                    hit in the head as well as the heart.</p>

                    <p>In 2022, Pent Up! released their first single, “Self-Titled, in March, followed closely by their
                    first EP, “Pretty Good”. The band flexed its DIY muscles by self-producing their October single,
                    “The End”, b/w a cover of The Cure's “Just Like Heaven”. On stage, the band found plenty of success,
                    opening for national (Tantric) and international (Australia's Big League) touring acts, as well as
                    headlining a successful show at the High Dive in Fremont.</p>

                    <p>In 2023, Pent Up! seeks to go even bigger, with numerous planned single releases and plenty of new
                    shows to help spread their brand of rambunctious rock to fans new and old. This year is a rocking
                    party, and Pent Up! is ready to bring down the house.</p>
